# Bring4You - Front-end test
 
 I use all the 3 hours to realise this test
 
### Fonctionality
I add all the fonctionality for the frontend part.
But i struggle to connect the Api, in postman I was able to retrieve the token but i did not manage to do anyting else.
This part made me waste a lot of time in research and I wanted to go faster, and this is the reason why my code is not clean.

### Impression
I do not complete all the recommendations requested to create the application due to the problem i encountered and the time available.

However I really enjoyed coding this application, I know that in other circumstances I can do way better.
